Welcome to the ModulartiyPOCS wiki!

**Thoughts**

My thoughts on the below topics and How would we go about achieving them. 

a. "why" part [why is it even required] 
b. strategies/steps/diagrams that would explain the solution.
c. tools that would be required to achieve the solution.

1. Modularity
2. Code quality
3. Maintainability & Adaptability
4. Continuous Integration.
5. Continuous Deployment.
6. Migration
     Database
     Code For.e.g o migrating from java 8 to java 12 
     Risk Analysis, Approach etc

Create POC for the below:

**Docker:**
1. Create a docker base image for with java 11/12 where you are required only to use certain modules.

**Kubernetes:**
1. Create a pod and expose a service for the pod
2. Create a service and expose to the outside world [come up with multiple answers]
3. rbac for Kubernetes
4. what is a side car container
5. Basic Architecture of Kubernetes
6. Rolling Updates
7. Service discovery in Kubernetes. [Compare it with Netflix OSS]
8. What is Ingress and Egress
9.Create a modular java 11/12 application, dockerise and orchestrate the application in Kubernetes.
